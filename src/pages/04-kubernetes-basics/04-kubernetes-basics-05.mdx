title: "Stateful Deployments"
---

As you know aÂ `Pod`Â is mortal, meaning it can be destroyed by Kubernetes anytime, and with it itâ€™s local data, memory, etc. So itâ€™s perfect for stateless applications. Of course, in the real world we need a way to store our data, and we need this data to be persistent in time.

So letâ€™s have a look on how how can we deploy a stateful application with a persistent storage in Kubernetes?

For this Lab we will deploy a mysql application.

## ðŸš€ TASK: Create Persistent Volumes

As stated above, the state of aÂ `Pod`Â is destroyed with it, so itâ€™s lost. For a database we need to be able to keep the data between restarts of theÂ `Pods`.

Thatâ€™s where theÂ `PersistentVolume`Â comes in.

As we have seen, aÂ `Pod`Â as something that requests CPU & RAM.

AÂ `PersistentVolume`Â as something that provides a storage on disk. Kubernetes handles a lot of different kinds of volumes. From local disk storage to s3, over 25 types as of this writing.

First we create theÂ `PersistentVolume`Â where our mysql data will be stored. It is a piece of storage in the cluster that has been provisioned by a cluster administrator. It is a resource in the cluster just like a node is a resource of the cluster.

```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: PersistentVolume
    metadata:
      name: mysql-pv-volume
    spec:
      capacity:
        storage: 1Gi
      accessModes:
        - ReadWriteOnce
      hostPath:
        path: "/mnt/data"
```    

Letâ€™s review some parameters:

*   `capacity`: the capacity of the volume
    *   `storage`: the volume size - hereÂ `1Gb`
*   `accessModes`: how this volume will be accessed, here ReadWriteOnce
    *   `ReadWriteOnce`: the volume can be mounted as read-write by a single node
    *   `ReadOnlyMany`: the volume can be mounted read-only by many nodes
    *   `ReadWriteMany`: the volume can be mounted as read-write by many nodes
*   `hostPath`: where the storage will be stored on the host, hereÂ `/mnt/data`Â (this is specific to the storage type)

We will useÂ `hostPath`Â for this example, it is a simple type ofÂ `Volume`Â but you shouldÂ **never ever**Â use it in production environements! Seriously!

1.  Create the PersistentVolume
    
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f ./volumes/1-simple-mysql-pv.yaml
    ```

    ```output   
    > persistentvolume/mysql-pv-volume created 
    ```    
    
2.  Check that the Volume has been created
    
    ```bash
    kubectl get pv
    ```

    ```output   
    > NAME              CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   RECLAIM POLICY   STATUS      CLAIM   STORAGECLASS   REASON   AGE
    > mysql-pv-volume   1Gi        RWO            Retain           Available                                   4s
    ```      
    

## ðŸš€ TASK: Create PersistentVolumeClaims

Now that we have a storage, we need to claim it, make it available for ourÂ `Pods`. So we need aÂ `PersistentVolumeClaim`. It is a request for storage by a user. It is similar to a pod. Pods consume node resources andÂ `PersistentVolumeClaim`Â consumeÂ `PersistentVolume`Â resources.

AÂ `PersistentVolumeClaim`Â as something that requests a storage on disk and makes it available for theÂ `Pod`Â think of it as an abstraction over the hard drives of the Kubernetes nodes - a fancy name for local hard drive.

The manifest for theÂ `PersistentVolumeClaim` is quite similar to theÂ `PersistentVolume`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
    name: mysql-pv-claim
spec:
    accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
    requests:
        storage: 1Gi
```    

1.  Create the PersistentVolume
    
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f ./volumes/2-simple-mysql-pvc.yaml
    ```

    ```output   
    > persistentvolumeclaim/mysql-pv-claim created
    ```        
    
2.  Check that the Volume has been created. Make sure that the STATUS reads Bound!
    
    ```bash
    kubectl get pvc
    ```

    ```output   
    > NAME             STATUS   VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS   AGE
    > mysql-pv-claim   Bound    pvc-918d5a94-06c7-11ea-80af-080027c4f0ca   1Gi        RWO            standard       5s
    ```
    

## ðŸš€ TASK: Create the stateful deployment

Now letâ€™s create the statefulÂ `deployment`Â for mysql.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
    name: mysql
spec:
    selector:
    matchLabels:
    app: mysql
    template:
    metadata:
    labels:
â€‹    app: mysql
    spec:
    containers:
â€‹  - image: mysql:5.6
â€‹     name: mysql
â€‹     env:
â€‹      - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
â€‹       value: password
â€‹     ports:
â€‹      - containerPort: 3306
â€‹       name: mysql
â€‹     volumeMounts:
â€‹       - name: mysql-persistent-storage
â€‹       mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
    volumes:
â€‹     - name: mysql-persistent-storage
â€‹     persistentVolumeClaim:
â€‹      claimName: mysql-pv-claim
```    

We define several things here:

*   `env`: the list of environment variables to pass to the container
    
    *   `name`: the name of the env variable
    *   `value`: the value of the env variable Here we pass the mysql root password to the container
*   `volumeMounts`: the volumes, that will be mapped into the container
    
    *   `name`: the name of the volume to mount
    *   `mountPath`: where in the container to mount the volume Here we map out the path where mysql stores its database files
*   `volumes`: the volumes to request access to
    
    *   `name`: the name of the volume, same asÂ `volumeMounts.name`
    *   `persistentVolumeClaim`: the PersistentVolumeClaim we want
        *   `claimName`: the name of the claim

1.  Create theÂ `Deployment`Â (this creates the deployment as well as the service to access the mysql container)
    
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f ./volumes/3-simple-mysql-deployment.yaml
    ```

    ```output   
    > deployment.apps/mysql created
    > service/mysql created
    ```

2.  Verify that theÂ `Deployment`Â has been created and is running (READY must be 1/1)
    
    ```bash
    kubectl get deployment
    ```

    ```output   
    > NAME    READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
    > mysql   0/1     1            0           8s
    ```yaml
    

## ðŸš€ TASK: Access the mysql database

1.  Now letâ€™s access the mysql container by running a mysql client in a temporary container:
    
    ```bash
    kubectl run -it --rm --image=mysql:8.0 --restart=Never mysql-client -- mysql -h mysql -ppassword
    ```

    If you don't see a command prompt, try pressing enter.
    
    ```bash
    mysql> 
    ```
    
2.  Create a new database in mysql:
    
    ```bash
    mysql> CREATE DATABASE testing;
    ```

    ```output   
    > Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)
    ```

    
3.  Check that it has been created
    
    ```bash
    mysql> show databases;
    ```

    ```output   
    > +--------------------+
    > | Database           |
    > +--------------------+
    > | information_schema |
    > | mysql              |
    > | performance_schema |
    > | testing            |
    > +--------------------+
    > 4 rows in set (0.00 sec)
    ```        
    
4.  Exit the mysql client
    
    ```bash
    mysql> exit
    ```

    ```output   
    > Bye
    > pod "mysql-client" deleted
    ```

5.  Get the list of Pods
    
    ```bash
    kubectl get pods
    ```

    ```output   
    > NAME                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    > mysql-7b9b7999d8-v4r5l   1/1     Running   0          4m26s
    ```

6.  Delete the Pod (youâ€™ll have to use the name of your Pod, which is dynamic)
    
    ```bash
    kubectl delete pod mysql-7b9b7999d8-v4r5l
    ```

    ```output   
    > pod "mysql-7b9b7999d8-v4r5l" deleted
    ```

7.  A new Pod has been spun up
    
    ```bash
    kubectl get pods
    ```

    ```output   
    > NAME                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    > mysql-7b9b7999d8-vqln7   1/1     Running   0          18s
    ```

8.  Recreate a mysql client
    
    ```bash
    kubectl run -it --rm --image=mysql:5.6 --restart=Never mysql-client -- mysql -h mysql -ppassword
    ```

    If you don't see a command prompt, try pressing enter.
    
    ```bash
    mysql> 
    ```

9.  Verify that the database testing is still there because it has been persisted in the PV through the PVC.
    
    ```bash
    mysql> show databases;
    ```

    ```output   
    > +--------------------+
    > | Database           |
    > +--------------------+
    > | information_schema |
    > | mysql              |
    > | performance_schema |
    > | testing            |
    > +--------------------+
    > 4 rows in set (0.00 sec)
    ```

    
10.  Exit the mysql client
    
    ```bash
    mysql> exit
    ```

    ```output   
    > Bye
    > pod "mysql-client" deleted
    ```        
    

## Conclusion

*   We have created a PersistentVolume that represents physical storage in the Kubernetes cluster.
*   We have created a PersistentVolumeClaim that maps this volume like a virtual harddisk and makes it available to Pods
*   We have created a mysql deployment that persists its data to the PersistentVolume
*   We have connected to the mysql instance and created a new database within
*   We have killed the mysql Pod, which would normally make it loose the data (the new database)
*   We have reconnected to the mysql instance to verify that the newly created database is still present
