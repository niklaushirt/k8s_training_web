title: "Deploy your first Pod"
---

## Introduction

You will learn what a pod is, deploy your first container, configure Kubernetes, and interact with Kubernetes in the command line.

The base elements of Kubernetes are pods. Kubernetes will choose how and where to run them. You can also see aÂ `Pod`Â as an object that requests some CPU and RAM. Kubernetes will take those requirements and decide where to run them.

A`Pod`Â can be killed and restarted whenever the system has/wants to. So aÂ `Pod`Â isÂ **ephemeral**Â and itÂ **will**Â be destroyed at some point.

## ðŸš€ TASK: Create the Pod

<InlineNotification kind="warning">

Make sure you are in the `training` directory!

</InlineNotification>

Letâ€™s start to deploy theÂ `nginx`Â docker image. Itâ€™s a simple webserver that is used widely in the Kubernetes world.

```bash         
kubectl run nginx --image=nginx     
```

```output   
> kubectl run --generator=deployment/apps.v1 is DEPRECATED and will be removed in a future version. Use kubectl run --generator=run-pod/v1 or kubectl create instead.
> deployment.apps/nginx created
```   

## ðŸš€ TASK: List the Pods

Now list all theÂ `Pods`Â running in Kubernetes.Â `kubectl get`Â is theÂ `ls`Â of Kubernetes.

```bash     
kubectl get pods
```

```output   
> NAME                     READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
> nginx-755464dd6c-2rbgj   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          32s
```

**Note the name of the Pod which is randomly generated!**

## ðŸš€ TASK: Get the yaml manifest

Now we can have a look at theÂ `yaml`Â description of ourÂ `Pod`

```bash     
kubectl get pods <name of pod from step 2> -o yaml
```

```output   
> apiVersion: v1
> kind: Pod
> metadata:
>   creationTimestamp: "2019-11-14T08:51:33Z"
>   generateName: nginx-755464dd6c-
>   labels:
>     pod-template-hash: 755464dd6c
>     run: nginx
>   name: nginx-755464dd6c-2rbgj
>   namespace: default
>   ownerReferences:
...
```

**Use the name of the Pod that you wrote down in step #2.**

Here is a simplified version that contains the main elements:

```yaml     
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
    name: nginx-755464dd6c-2rbgj
spec:
    containers:
    - name: nginx
    image: nginx  #hosted on hub.docker.com
```

The Kubernetes manifest represents a desired state. We do not write the steps to achieve this state. Kubernetes will handle it for us.

Letâ€™s have a look at the most important fields:

*   `apiVersion`: the version of the Kubernetes API we will be using,Â `v1`Â here
*   `kind`: what resource this object represents,Â `Pod`Â for this example
*   `metadata`: some metadata about this pod, like its name.
*   `spec`: specification of the desired behavior of thisÂ `Pod`
    *   `containers`: the list of containers to start in thisÂ `Pod`
        *   `name`: the name of the container
        *   `image`: which image to start

## ðŸš€ TASK: Describe the Pod

`Describe`Â gives us a lot of information about the status and events of a Kubernetes object.

```bash     
kubectl describe pods <name of pod from step 2>
```

```output   

> Events:
>  Type    Reason     Age   From               Message
>
> ----    ------     ----  ----               -------
>
>  Normal  Scheduled  90s   default-scheduler  Successfully assigned default/nginx-755464dd6c-2rbgj to minikube
>  Normal  Pulling    82s   kubelet, minikube  Pulling image "nginx"
>  Normal  Pulled     36s   kubelet, minikube  Successfully pulled image "nginx"
>  Normal  Created    36s   kubelet, minikube  Created container nginx
>  Normal  Started    34s   kubelet, minikube  Started container nginx
```    


## ðŸš€ TASK: Clean-up

Now to wrap this up, letâ€™s delete theÂ `Pod`

```bash     
kubectl delete pod nginx
```
