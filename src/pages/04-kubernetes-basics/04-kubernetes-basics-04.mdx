title: "Scale and Update Deployments"
---

In this lab, youâ€™ll learn how to update the number of instances a deployment has and how to modify the API backend.

> For this lab, you need a running deployment of theÂ `k8sdemo`Â application from the previous lab. If you deleted it, recreate it.

## ðŸš€ TASK: Scale apps with replicas

AÂ _replica_Â is a copy of a pod that contains a running service. By having multiple replicas of a pod, you can ensure your deployment has the available resources to handle increasing load on your application.

1.  `kubectl`Â provides aÂ `scale`Â subcommand to change the size of an existing deployment. Letâ€™s increase our capacity from a single running instance ofÂ `k8sdemo`Â up to 10 instances:

    ```bash
    kubectl scale --replicas=4 deployment k8sdemo-backend -n default
    ```

    ```output   
     > deployment "k8sdemo" scaled
    ```

Kubernetes will now try to make reality match the desired state of 4 replicas by starting 2 new pods with the same configuration as the first.

1.  To verify that your changes have been rolled out, you can run:

    ```bash
    kubectl get pods -n default
    ```

    ```output   
    > NAME                              READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    > k8sdemo-7d46f69d68-xcgcw          1/1       Running   0          19m
    > k8sdemo-backend-9c777544b-cp59q   1/1       Running   0          12m
    > k8sdemo-backend-9c777544b-jqjz9   1/1       Running   0          12m
    > k8sdemo-backend-9c777544b-lwssx   1/1       Running   0          12m
    > k8sdemo-backend-9c777544b-t5mlq   1/1       Running   0          12m
    ```

You should see output listing 4 replicas of your deployment.

6. Forward the local port again to the frontend service in your Cluster:
    
    ```bash
    kubectl port-forward --namespace default $(kubectl get po -n default -l app=k8sdemo | grep k8sdemo | \awk '{print $1;}') 3000:3000
   ```         

    And then navigating toÂ [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)Â in your browser.
    
4.  If you reload the webpage several times, you should see, tht the IP Address of the backend API Pod is changing between the four Pods that have been spun up.
    
8. Hit `CTRL-C` several times to cancel the port forward
