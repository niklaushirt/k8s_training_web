title: "Deploy your first application"
---

Learn how to deploy an application to a Kubernetes cluster.

Once your client is configured, you are ready to deploy your first application,Â `k8sdemo`.

## ðŸ’¡ INFO: The frontend example application

In this part of the lab we will deploy an application calledÂ `k8sdemo`Â that has already been built and uploaded to DockerHub under the nameÂ `niklaushirt/k8sdemo`.

We will use the following yaml:

```yaml
kind: Deployment
metadata:
    name: k8sdemo
    namespace: default
spec:
    replicas: 1
    template:
    metadata:
        labels:
        app: k8sdemo
    spec:
        containers:
        - name: k8sdemo
        image: niklaushirt/k8sdemo:1.0.0
    ...
            env:   
            - name: PORT
            value : "3000"
            - name: APPLICATION_NAME
            value: k8sdemo
            - name: BACKEND_URL
            value: http://k8sdemo-backend-service.default.svc:3000/api
```    

It defines the Container image to deploy (with 1 instances/replicas) and an environment variable BACKEND\_URL that points to the backend servcie we will be deploying in the next section.


    

## ðŸš€ TASK: Deploy the frontend application

1.  Start by runningÂ `k8sdemo`
    
    ```bash
    kubectl create -f ./deployment/demoapp.yaml
    ```

    This action will take a bit of time. To check the status of the running application, you can useÂ 
    
    ```bash
        kubectl get pods -n default 
    ```

    You should see output similar to the following:

    ```output   
        > NAME                       READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
        > k8sdemo-7d46f69d68-bd2cw   0/1       Running   0          17s  
    ```


2.  Eventually, the status should show up asÂ `1/1 Running`.
    
    ```bash
    kubectl get pods -n default     
    ```

    ```output   
    > NAME                          READY     STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
    > k8sdemo-7d46f69d68-bd2cw      1/1       Running             0          5m
    ```

    The end result of the run command is to create a Deployment resource that manages the lifecycle of those pods.
    
3.  Once the status readsÂ `Running`, we need to expose that deployment as a service so we can access it through the IP of the worker nodes. TheÂ `k8sdemo`Â application listens on port 3000.
    
    Run:
    
    ```bash
    kubectl expose deployment k8sdemo --name k8sdemo-service -n default --type="NodePort" --port=3000
    ```

    ```output   
    > service "k8sdemo-service" exposed
    ```
    
4.  To find the port used on that worker node, examine your new service:
    
    ```bash
    kubectl get service -n default k8sdemo-service
    ```

    ```output   
    > NAME              TYPE       CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
    > k8sdemo-service   NodePort   10.109.30.227   <none>        3000:30931/TCP   11m
    ```        
    
    We can see that our in this example`<nodeport>`Â isÂ `31208`. We can see in the output the port mapping from 3000 inside the pod exposed to the cluster on port 30931. This port in the 31000 range is automatically chosen, andÂ **will probably be different for you**.
    
5.  `k8sdemo`Â is now running on your cluster, and exposed to the internet.
    





6. You can open the webpage by forwarding a local port to the service in your Cluster:
    
    ```bash
    kubectl port-forward --namespace default $(kubectl get po -n default -l app=k8sdemo | grep k8sdemo | \awk '{print $1;}') 3000:3000
   ```         

    And then navigating toÂ [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)Â in your browser.
    
6.  YourÂ `k8sdemo`Â should now be open in the your default browser. However it will show an error, because we have not yet deployed the backend.
    
    **Testing DEMO\_API STATUS: ERROR Trying to reach backend â€¦.**
    
8. Hit `CTRL-C` several times to cancel the port forward


## ðŸš€ TASK: Deploy the application backend

In this part of the lab we will deploy the application backend calledÂ `k8sdemo-backend`Â that has already been built and uploaded to DockerHub under the nameÂ `niklaushirt/k8sdemo-backend`.

1.  Start by runningÂ `k8sdemo-backend`
    
    ```bash
    kubectl create -f ./deployment/demoapp-backend.yaml
    ```        
    
    This action will take a bit of time. To check the status of the running application, you can useÂ `kubectl get pods`.
    
    You should see output similar to the following:
    
    ```bash
    kubectl get pods -n default
    ```

    ```output   
    > NAME                              READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    > k8sdemo-7d46f69d68-xcgcw          0/1       Running   0          13m
    > k8sdemo-backend-9c777544b-cp59q   0/1       Running   0          1m
    > k8sdemo-backend-9c777544b-jqjz9   0/1       Running   0          1m  
    ```
    
    Eventually, the status should show up asÂ `1/1 Running`.
    
    ```bash
    kubectl get pods -n default
    ```

    ```output   
    > NAME                              READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    > k8sdemo-7d46f69d68-xcgcw          1/1       Running   0          13m
    > k8sdemo-backend-9c777544b-cp59q   1/1       Running   0          6m35s
    > k8sdemo-backend-9c777544b-jqjz9   1/1       Running   0          6m35s
    ```

    The end result of the run command is to create a Deployment resource that manages the lifecycle of those pods.
    
2.  Once the status readsÂ `Running`, we need to expose that deployment as a service so we can access it through the IP of the worker nodes. TheÂ `k8sdemo`Â application listens on port 3000. Run:
    
    ```bash
    kubectl expose deployment k8sdemo-backend --name k8sdemo-backend-service -n default --type="NodePort" --port=3000
    ```

    ```output   
    > service "k8sdemo-service" exposed
    ```

6. Forward the local port again to the frontend service in your Cluster:
    
    ```bash
    kubectl port-forward --namespace default $(kubectl get po -n default -l app=k8sdemo | grep k8sdemo | \awk '{print $1;}') 3000:3000
   ```         

    And then navigating toÂ [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)Â in your browser.
    
    
3.  Now reload the webpage and verify, that it shows
    
    **Testing DEMO\_API STATUS: OK â€¦.**
    
4.  If you reload the webpage several times, you should see, tht the IP Address of the backend API Pod is changing between the two Pods that have been spun up.
    
8. Hit `CTRL-C` several times to cancel the port forward
