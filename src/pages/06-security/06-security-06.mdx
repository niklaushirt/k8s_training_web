## Rakkess

Have you ever wondered what access rights you have on a provided kubernetes cluster? For single resources you can use kubectl auth can-i list deployments, but maybe you are looking for a complete overview? This is what rakkess is for. It lists access rights for the current user and all server resources.

You can get more details [here](https://github.com/corneliusweig/rakkess).

1.  Install Rakkess for [your platform](https://github.com/corneliusweig/rakkess#installation)   
    
2.  Let’s examine the RBAC for the default Namespace:
    
    ```bash
    rakkess -n default
    ```        
    
    ![](./../images/rbac1.png)
    
3.  And now the RBAC for the ServiceAccount that we have created earlier:
    
    ```bash
    rakkess --sa service-account-1 -n default
    ```        	
        
    
    ![](./../images/rbac2.png)
    
    We can see that the `ServiceAccount` has the rights to list `Services` and to create `ConfigMaps`. This corresponds to the `api-role` `Role` that we have defined earlier:
    
    ```yaml
    ...
    - apiGroups: [""]
        resources: ["services"]
        verbs: ["get", "list"]
    - apiGroups: [""]
        resources: ["configmaps"]
        verbs: ["create"]
        ...
    ```        
    

## rbac-view

Polaris runs a variety of checks to ensure that Kubernetes pods and controllers are configured using best practices, helping you avoid problems in the future.

You can get more details [here](https://github.com/jasonrichardsmith/rbac-view).

1.  Install rbac-view
    
    ```bash
    #Linux
    wget https://github.com/jasonrichardsmith/rbac-view/releases/download/v0.2.1/rbac-view.v0.2.1.linux.tar.gz
    tar xf rbac-view.v0.2.1.linux.tar.gz
    chmod +x ./bin/linux/rbac-view
    sudo mv -i ./bin/linux/rbac-view $GOPATH/bin/rbac-view
    
    
    #Mac
    wget https://github.com/jasonrichardsmith/rbac-view/releases/download/v0.2.1/rbac-view.v0.2.1.darwin.tar.gz
    tar xf rbac-view.v0.2.1.darwin.tar.gz
    chmod +x ./bin/darwin/rbac-view
    sudo mv -i ./bin/linux/rbac-view /usr/local/bin/rbac-view
    ```        
    
2.  Run the following in your Terminal:
    
    ```bash
    rbac-view 
    ```        	
        
    ```output
    > INFO[0000] Getting K8s client                           
    > INFO[0000] serving RBAC View and http://localhost:8800            
    ```        
    
3.  Open the followin URL in your browser: [http://localhost:8800](http://localhost:8800/)
    
4.  Rbac-view will then run some initialization which may take some time.


    ```output
    > INFO[0000] Getting K8s client                           
    > INFO[0000] serving RBAC View and http://localhost:8800  
    ...
    > INFO[0039] Building full matrix for json                
    > INFO[0039] Building Matrix for Roles                    
    > INFO[0039] Retrieving RoleBindings                      
    > INFO[0039] Building Matrix for ClusterRoles             
    > INFO[0039] Retrieving ClusterRoleBindings               
    > INFO[0039] Retrieved 49 ClusterRoleBindings             
    > INFO[0039] Retrieving ClusterRole system:volume-scheduler 
    > INFO[0039] Retrieving ClusterRole system:controller:horizontal-pod-autoscaler 
    > INFO[0039] Retrieving ClusterRole system:controller:generic-garbage-collector 
    > INFO[0039] Retrieving ClusterRole system:controller:job-controller 
    > INFO[0039] Retrieving ClusterRole cilium  
    ... 
    > INFO[0048] Retrieving Role system:controller:bootstrap-signer in namespace kube-public 
    > INFO[0048] Retrieving Role kubernetes-dashboard in namespace kubernetes-dashboard 
    > INFO[0048] Retrieving Role deployment-manager in namespace rbactest 
    > INFO[0051] Built Matrix for Roles                       
    > INFO[0051] Matrix for json built           
    ```        
    
5.  Enter `cluster` in the `SearchRoles` field and examine the `cluster-admin` `Role`. The `*` means that it has all access rights to all ressources with all verbs.

6.  Switch to the Roles tab and enter `api-role` in the `SearchRoles` field and examine it. We can see the access rights previously discussed, notably `get` and `list` rights to `Services`.
    
    ![](./../images/rbac6.png)
    
7.  When you click on the Subjects button you will get the list of Subjects for this `Role`. In this cas we can see the `ServiceAccount` `service-account-1` that is a subject of the Role.
