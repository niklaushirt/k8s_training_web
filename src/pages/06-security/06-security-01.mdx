# Preparation

1.  Open a Terminal window by clicking on the Termnial icon in the left sidebar - we will use this extensively later as well
    
2.  Start the demo application
    
    ```bash
    kubectl create -f ./training/deployment/demoapp.yaml
    kubectl create -f ./training/deployment/demoapp-service.yaml
    kubectl create -f ./training/deployment/demoapp-backend.yaml
    kubectl create -f ./training/deployment/demoapp-backend-service.yaml
    ```
        
    
3.  Wait for the demo application to be available (the status must be 1/1)
    
    ```bash
    kubectl get pods
    ```        
    
    ```output
    > NAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    > k8sdemo-backend-5b779f567f-2rbgj   1/1     Running   0          21s
    > k8sdemo-backend-5b779f567f-p6j76   1/1     Running   0          21s
    > k8sdemo-bd6bbd548-jcb6r            1/1     Running   0          21s
    ```        
    
4.  Open the demo application in the browser
    
    
    Open the webpage directly by typing:
    
    ```bash
    minikube service k8sdemo-service
    ```            
        
    
    where k8sdemo-service is the name of the exposed kubernetes service.
    
        
    
5. Navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser.
