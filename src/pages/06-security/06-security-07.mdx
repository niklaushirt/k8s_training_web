title: "Image Scanning"

## Deploy Clair

In this chapter we will deploy the Clair image scanner and scan an example image.

[Clair](https://github.com/quay/clair) is an open source project for the static analysis of vulnerabilities in application containers (currently including appc and docker).

1.  In regular intervals, Clair ingests vulnerability metadata from a configured set of sources and stores it in the database.
2.  Clients use the Clair API to index their container images; this creates a list of features present in the image and stores them in the database.
3.  Clients use the Clair API to query the database for vulnerabilities of a particular image; correlating vulnerabilities and features is done for each request, avoiding the need to rescan images.
4.  When updates to vulnerability metadata occur, a notification can be sent to alert systems that a change has occurred.

To make things easier we will use the [Klar](https://github.com/optiopay/klar) command line tool to interact with the Clair engine.

### Install the Klar command line tool

```bash
#Linux
wget https://github.com/optiopay/klar/releases/download/v2.4.0/klar-2.4.0-linux-amd64
sudo chmod +x klar-2.4.0-linux-amd64
sudo mv klar-2.4.0-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/klar

#Mac
wget https://github.com/optiopay/klar/releases/download/v2.4.0/klar-2.4.0-osx-amd64
sudo chmod +x klar-2.4.0-osx-amd64
sudo mv klar-2.4.0-osx-amd64 /usr/local/bin/klar
```    

​

### Deploy Clair into the Kubernetes Cluster

1.  Go to the directory with the clair resources
    
    ```bash
    cd ./training/clair
    ```        	
        
    
2.  Create the Secret that holds the Clair configuration
    
    ```bash
    kubectl create secret generic clairsecret --from-file=./config.yaml
    ```        	
        
    ```output
    > from-file=./config.yaml
    > secret/clairsecret created
    ```        
    
3.  Deploy Clair
    
    ```bash
    kubectl create -f clair-kubernetes.yaml
    ```        	
        
    ```output
    > service/clairsvc created
    > replicationcontroller/clair created
    > replicationcontroller/clair-postgres created
    > service/postgres created
    ```

    
4.  Wait for Clair to be running (Ready is 1/1)
    
    ```bash
    kubectl get pods
    ```        	
        
    ```output
    > NAME                   READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
    > clair-jcb6r            1/1     Running             0          17s
    > clair-postgres-2rbgj   1/1     Running             0          17s
    ```        
    

## Use Klar to scan an Image

Klar is a simple tool to analyze images stored in a private or public Docker registry for security vulnerabilities using Clair. Klar is designed to be used integrated in other CI/CD tools. It’s a single binary which requires no dependencies.

Klar returns:

*   0 if the number of detected high severity vulnerabilities in an image is less than or equal to a threshold
*   1 if there were more.
*   2 if an error has prevented the image from being scanned

1.  Get the Cluster IP (MY-CLUSTER-IP)
        
    
    ```bash
    minikube ip
    ```        	
        
    
        
    
2.  Execute the following command
    
    ```bash
    CLAIR_ADDR=<MY-CLUSTER-IP>:30060 FORMAT_OUTPUT=table CLAIR_OUTPUT=High klar niklaushirt/k8sdemo:1.0.1 	
    ```
    
    ```output
    > clair timeout 1m0s
    > docker timeout: 1m0s
    > no whitelist file
    > Analysing 14 layers
    > Got results from Clair API v1
    > Found 597 vulnerabilities
    > Unknown: 176
    > Negligible: 284
    > Low: 135
    > Medium: 2
    ```output
        
    
    We define several things here:
    
    *   `CLAIR_ADDR` : the address of the Clair server
    *   `FORMAT_OUTPUT` : the format for the output (table in this example)
    *   `CLAIR_OUTPUT` : output only vulnerabilities above or equal
    
    The output shows that there are no HIGH severity vulerabilities.
    
    > **Initialization of Clair takes some time!** If the output shows a completely different count than in this example you have to wait for Clair to ingest all security rules first.
    
3.  Now let’s execute it again with a lower OUTPUT (Medium)
    
    ```bash
    CLAIR_ADDR=<MY-CLUSTER-IP>:30060 FORMAT_OUTPUT=table CLAIR_OUTPUT=Medium klar niklaushirt/k8sdemo:1.0.1
    ```        	
        
    ```output
    > clair timeout 1m0s
    > docker timeout: 1m0s
    > no whitelist file
    > Analysing 14 layers
    > Got results from Clair API v1
    > Found 597 vulnerabilities
    > Unknown: 176
    > Negligible: 284
    > Low: 135
    > Medium: 2

    ```    
        
    

The output shows the detail for the two vulnerabilities with Medum severity.

You can also output the result to JSON Format to be reused in a CI/CD tool.
