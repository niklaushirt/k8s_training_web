# Persistent Volumes

## Introduction

As you know a `Pod` is mortal, meaning it can be destroyed by Kubernetes anytime, and with it it’s local data, memory, etc. So it’s perfect for stateless applications. Of course, in the real world we need a way to store our data, and we need this data to be persistent in time. You have alread had a first contact with PersistentVolumes in JTC02, but now let’s have a closer look on how how can we dynamically create PersistentVolumes and deploy a Wordpress/MySQL Application with dynamic persistent storage.

### Persistent Volumes - Refresher

As stated above, the state of a `Pod` is destroyed with it, so it’s lost. For a database we need to be able to keep the data between restarts of the `Pods`.

That’s where the `PersistentVolume` comes in.

As we have seen, a `Pod` as something that requests CPU & RAM.

A `PersistentVolume` as something that provides a storage on disk. Kubernetes handles a lot of different kinds of volumes. From local disk storage to s3, over 25 as of this writing.

First we create the `PersistentVolume` where our data will be stored. It is a piece of storage in the cluster that has been provisioned by a cluster administrator or a dynamic provisioner. It is a resource in the cluster just like a node is a resource of the cluster.

Copy

     
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: PersistentVolume
    metadata:
      name: mysql-pv-volume
    spec:
      capacity:
        storage: 1Gi
      accessModes:
        - ReadWriteOnce
      hostPath:
        path: "/mnt/data"
    
    

Let’s review some parameters:

*   `capacity`: the capacity of the volume
    *   `storage`: the volume size - here `1Gb`
*   `accessModes`: how this volume will be accessed, here ReadWriteOnce
    *   `ReadWriteOnce`: the volume can be mounted as read-write by a single node
    *   `ReadOnlyMany`: the volume can be mounted read-only by many nodes
    *   `ReadWriteMany`: the volume can be mounted as read-write by many nodes
*   `hostPath`: where the storage will be stored on the host, here `/mnt/data` (this is specific to the storage type)

`hostPath` is a simple type of `Volume` but you should **never** use it in production environements because it is unable to move between Nodes!

### PersistentVolumeClaims - Refresher

Now that we have a storage, we need to claim it, make it available for our `Pods`. So we need a `PersistentVolumeClaim`. It is a request for storage by a user. It is similar to a pod. Pods consume node resources and `PersistentVolumeClaim` consume `PersistentVolume` resources.

A `PersistentVolumeClaim` as something that requests a storage on disk and makes it available for the `Pod` think of it as an abstraction over the hard drives of the Kubernetes nodes - a fancy name for local hard drive.

## Create a Persistent Volume Claim

In this example we are going to create a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) that consumes the Block StorageClass.

1.  Create the PVC
    
    Copy
    
         
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
        metadata:
        	name: simple-test-pvc
        spec:
        	accessModes:
        		- ReadWriteMany 
        	resources:
        		requests:
        			storage: 50Mi
        	
        
    
    Create it by running:
    
    Copy
    
         
        kubectl create -f ./volumes/simple-pvc.yaml
        	
        
    
        > persistentvolumeclaim/simple-test-pvc created
        
    
2.  Check the PersistentVolumeClaim
    
    The STATUS must be `Bound`, which means that there has been a PersistentVolume created dynamically
    
    Copy
    
         
        kubectl get pvc
        	
        
    
        > NAME            STATUS   VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS      AGE
        > simple-test-pvc   Bound    pvc-ff3c6664-9d71-42e1-b403-277b3fcd532f   50Mi       RWX            standard           2s
        
    
3.  Check the PersistentVolume
    
    The PersistentVolume has been created dynamically
    
    Copy
    
         
        kubectl get pv
        	
        
    
        > NAME                                       CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   RECLAIM POLICY   STATUS   CLAIM                   STORAGECLASS      REASON   AGE
        > pvc-ff3c6664-9d71-42e1-b403-277b3fcd532f   50Mi       RWX            Delete           Bound    default/simple-test-pvc   standard                    48s
        
    
4.  Cleanup: Delete the PersistentVolumeClaim
    
    Copy
    
         
        kubectl delete pvc ./volumes/simple-pvc.yaml
        	
        
    
        > persistentvolumeclaim "ceph-test-pvc" deleted
        
    
5.  Check the PersistentVolume
    
    The PersistentVolume has been deleted automatically as well
    
    Copy
    
         
        kubectl get pv
        	
        
    
        > No resources found in default namespace.
        
    

## Dynamic Minikube default provisioner

StorageClasses are at the heart of dynamic provisioning. By asking declaratively for a type of storage, your Dynamic Provisioner can decide how to fulfill that storage at runtime. This is what allows your application to run exactly the same on minikube as it would on other clouds or Container Management platforms.

Minikube works with dynamic provisioning **out of the box.** And that the way it works is by defining a **provisioner.** In the example before we have seen that we can create a PersistentVolumeClaim without specifying a StorageClass. In this case the default StorageClass is chosen and the PersistentVolume is being created automatically.

1.  List the available StorageClasses
    
    Copy
    
         
        kubectl get sc
        	
        
    
        > NAME                         PROVISIONER                RECLAIMPOLICY   VOLUMEBINDINGMODE   ALLOWVOLUMEEXPANSION   AGE
        > standard (default)           k8s.io/minikube-hostpath   Delete          Immediate           false                  7d20h
        
    
2.  Get the YAML manifets for Minikubes standard StorageClass
    
    Copy
    
         
        kubectl get sc standard -o yaml
        	
        
    
    The output looks something like this:
    
    Copy
    
         
        apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
        kind: StorageClass
        metadata:
        	annotations:
        		storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class: "true"
        	...
        	name: standard
        	...
        provisioner: k8s.io/minikube-hostpath
        reclaimPolicy: Delete
        volumeBindingMode: Immediate
        	
        
    
    The important elements are:
    
    *   **name** : The name of the StorageClass
    *   **is-default-class**: Tells the provisionor to use this class if nothing is specified
    *   **provisioner**: Minikube includes a minikube-hostpath provisioner
3.  Patch the StorageClass to not be defaulted anymore
    
    Copy
    
         
        kubectl patch storageclass standard -p '{"metadata": {"annotations":{"storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class":"false"}}}'
        	
        
    
        > storageclass.storage.k8s.io/standard patched
        
    
4.  Let’s try again to create the PVC
    
    Copy
    
         
        kubectl create -f ./volumes/simple-pvc.yaml
        	
        
    
        > persistentvolumeclaim/simple-test-pvc created
        
    
5.  Check the PersistentVolumeClaim
    
    The STATUS will be stuck at `Pending`, because Kubernetes can not determine the StorageClass to use.
    
    Copy
    
         
        kubectl get pvc
        	
        
    
        > NAME            STATUS   VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS      AGE
        
    
6.  Cleanup: Delete the PersistentVolumeClaim
    
    Copy
    
         
        kubectl delete pvc ./volumes/simple-pvc.yaml
        	
        
    
        > persistentvolumeclaim "ceph-test-pvc" deleted
        
    

## Create a StorageClass

In this example we are going to create a custom StorageClass called `my-storage-class` by using the Minikube dynamic provisioner.

1.  Create the StorageClass
    
    Copy
    
         
        kind: StorageClass
        apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
        metadata:
        	name: my-storage-class
        	annotations:
        		storageclass.beta.kubernetes.io/is-default-class: "true"
        	labels:
        		addonmanager.kubernetes.io/mode: Reconcile
        provisioner: k8s.io/minikube-hostpath
        	
        
    
    Create it by running:
    
    Copy
    
         
        kubectl create -f ./volumes/storage-class.yaml
        	
        
    
        > storageclass.storage.k8s.io/my-storage-class created
        
    
2.  List the StorageClasses
    
    Copy
    
         
        kubectl get sc
        	
        
    
        > NAME                         PROVISIONER                RECLAIMPOLICY   VOLUMEBINDINGMODE   ALLOWVOLUMEEXPANSION   AGE
        > my-storage-class (default)   k8s.io/minikube-hostpath   Delete          Immediate           false                  43s
        > standard                     k8s.io/minikube-hostpath   Delete          Immediate           false                  7d21h
        
    

We can see that the new StorageClass has been made the default, thanks to the annotation in the YAML manifest.

## Create DB with Persistence

Now let’s create a more complex application that consumes our new StorageClass. For this we use a MySQL/Wordpress Demo modified from the Rook/Ceph Git repository.

First we create the MySQL Deployment.

1.  Create the MySQL Database
    
    The manifest that we are going to apply looks like this:
    
    Copy
    
         
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
        metadata:
        	name: mysql-pv-claim
        	labels:
        		app: wordpress
        spec:
        	storageClassName: my-storage-class
        	accessModes:
        	- ReadWriteOnce
        	resources:
        		requests:
        			storage: 20Gi
        ---
        apiVersion: apps/v1
        kind: Deployment
        metadata:
        	name: wordpress-mysql
        ...
        spec:
        	...
        	template:
        		...
        		spec:
        			...
        			containers:
        			- image: mysql:5.6
        			...
        				volumeMounts:
        				- name: mysql-persistent-storage
        					mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
        			volumes:
        			- name: mysql-persistent-storage
        				persistentVolumeClaim:
        					claimName: mysql-pv-claim
        	
        
    
    This creates a PersistentVolumeClaim called `mysql-pv-claim` that is being mapped into the MySQL Pod at `/var/lib/mysql`.
    
    Create it by running:
    
    Copy
    
         
        kubectl create -f ./volumes/mysql.yaml 
        	
        
    
        > service/wordpress-mysql created
        > persistentvolumeclaim/mysql-pv-claim created
        > deployment.apps/wordpress-mysql created
        
    
2.  Check the PersistentVolumeClaim
    
    The STATUS must be `Bound`, which means that there has been a PersistentVolume created dynamically
    
    Copy
    
         
        kubectl get pvc
        	
        
    
        > NAME            STATUS   VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS      AGE
        > mysql-pv-claim    Bound     pvc-bccef708-10dc-4c02-992b-556179af3613   20Gi       RWO            standard           42m
        
    

## Application with Persistence

Now let’s create the Wordpress Deployment.

1.  Create the MySQL Database
    
    The manifest that we are going to apply looks like this:
    
    Copy
    
         
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
        metadata:
        	name: wp-pv-claim
        	labels:
        		app: wordpress
        spec:
        	storageClassName: my-storage-class
        	accessModes:
        	- ReadWriteOnce
        	resources:
        		requests:
        			storage: 20Gi
        ---
        apiVersion: apps/v1
        kind: Deployment
        metadata:
        	name: wordpress
        	labels:
        		app: wordpress
        		tier: frontend
        spec:
        	...
        	template:
        		...
        		spec:
        			containers:
        			- image: wordpress:4.6.1-apache
        				name: wordpress
        				volumeMounts:
        				- name: wordpress-persistent-storage
        					mountPath: /var/www/html
        			volumes:
        			- name: wordpress-persistent-storage
        				persistentVolumeClaim:
        					claimName: wp-pv-claim
        	
        
    
    This creates a PersistentVolumeClaim called `wp-pv-claim` that is being mapped into the Wordpress Pod at `/var/www/html`.
    
    Create it by running:
    
    Copy
    
         
        kubectl create -f ./volumes/wordpress.yaml 
        	
        
    
        > service/wordpress created
        > persistentvolumeclaim/wp-pv-claim created
        > deployment.apps/wordpress created
        
    
2.  Check the PersistentVolumeClaim
    
    The STATUS must be `Bound` on both PersistentVolumeClaims.
    
    Copy
    
         
        kubectl get pvc
        	
        
    
        > NAME            STATUS   VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS      AGE
        > mysql-pv-claim    Bound     pvc-bccef708-10dc-4c02-992b-556179af3613   20Gi       RWO            standard           42m
        > wp-pv-claim       Bound     pvc-004f32e0-4a2c-447a-ae27-f7cd63ea9689   20Gi       RWO            standard           41m
        
    
3.  You can now open Workdpress and play around a bit
    
    Copy
    
         
        minikube service wordpress
        	
        
    

## Check persisted files

Let’s have a look on how and where the data is being persisted.

1.  Examine the PersistentVolumes
    
    Copy
    
         
        kubectl get pv -o yaml
        	
        
    
    You’ll get something like this for the two PVs:
    
    Copy
    
         
        ...
        - apiVersion: v1
        	kind: PersistentVolume
        	metadata:
        		...
        	spec:
        		accessModes:
        		- ReadWriteOnce
        		capacity:
        			storage: 20Gi
        		claimRef:
        			apiVersion: v1
        			kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
        			name: mysql-pv-claim
        			namespace: default
        			resourceVersion: "112147"
        			uid: bccef708-10dc-4c02-992b-556179af3613
        		hostPath:
        			path: /tmp/hostpath-provisioner/pvc-bccef708-10dc-4c02-992b-556179af3613
        			type: ""
        		persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Delete
        		storageClassName: standard
        		volumeMode: Filesystem
        	...
        	
        
    
    The interesting part is the hostPath (/tmp/hostpath-provisioner/pvc-bccef708-10dc-4c02-992b-556179af3613). This is where the data for this PersistentVolume is stored.
    
2.  Copy the path.
    
3.  SSH into Minikube
    
    Copy
    
         
        minikube ssh
        	
        
    
4.  Go to the storage location
    
    Copy
    
         
        cd /tmp/hostpath-provisioner/pvc-bccef708-10dc-4c02-992b-556179af3613
        	
        
    
5.  Have a look at the files (can be MySQL or Workdpress, depending on the PV that you selected)
    
    Copy
    
         
        ls
        	
        
    
        > auto.cnf  ib_logfile0  ib_logfile1  ibdata1  mysql  performance_schema  wordpress
