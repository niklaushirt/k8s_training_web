title: "Init Containers"
---


Init containers are specialized containers that run before or after app containers in a Pod. They can contain utilities or setup scripts not present in an app image.

Init containers are exactly like regular containers, except:

*   Init containers always run to completion.
    
*   Each init container must complete successfully before the next one starts.
    
*   If you specify multiple init containers for a Pod, Kubelet runs each init container sequentially.
    
*   If a Pod’s init container fails, Kubernetes repeatedly restarts the Pod until the init container succeeds.
    
*   Init containers support all the fields and features of app containers, including resource limits, volumes, and security settings, however they do not support lifecycle, livenessProbe, readinessProbe, or startupProbe for obvious reasons.

## Init Containers Applied

1.  Run a standard nginx container
    
    Copy
    
         
        apiVersion: apps/v1
        kind: Deployment
        metadata:
        	name: nginx-demo
        	namespace: default
        	labels:
        		app: nginx-demo
        spec:
        	selector:
        		matchLabels:
        			app: nginx-demo
        	replicas: 1
        	template:
        		metadata:
        			labels:
        				app: nginx-demo
        		spec:
        			containers:
        			- name: nginx
        				image: nginx
        				imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent 
        				ports:
        				- containerPort: 80
        	
        
    
    Copy
    
         
        kubectl apply -f ./initContainers/container.yaml
        	
        
    
2.  Expose it with a service
    
    Copy
    
         
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Service
        metadata:
        	name: nginx-demo-service
        spec:
        	selector:
        		app: nginx-demo
        	ports:
        		- protocol: TCP
        			port: 8000
        			targetPort: 80
        	type: NodePort
        	
        
    
    Copy
    
         
        kubectl apply -f ./initContainers/service.yaml
        	
        
    
3.  Open the deployment in Firefox
    
    Copy
    
         
        minikube service nginx-demo-service
        	
        
    
    You should see the default nginx welcome page.
    

TODO

1.  Update the deployment with the init container
    
    Copy
    
         
        apiVersion: apps/v1
        kind: Deployment
        metadata:
        	name: nginx-demo-init
        	namespace: default
        	labels:
        		app: nginx-demo
        spec:
        	selector:
        		matchLabels:
        			app: nginx-demo
        	replicas: 1
        	template:
        		metadata:
        			labels:
        				app: nginx-demo
        		spec:
        			containers:
        			- name: nginx
        				image: nginx
        				imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent 
        				ports:
        				- containerPort: 80
        				
        			#Volume mapped into the nginx pod
        			volumeMounts:
        			- name: workdir
        				mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
        				
        		#This container is run during pod initialization
        		initContainers:
        
        		#Sleep for 2 Seconds
        		- name: sleep-1
        			image: busybox
        			imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        			command: ['sh', '-c', 'echo sleep-1 start; sleep 2;echo sleep-1 complete;']
        		
        		#Sleep again for 2 Seconds
        		- name: sleep-2
        			image: busybox
        			imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        			command: ['sh', '-c', 'echo sleep-2 start; sleep 2;echo sleep-2 complete;']
        		- name: install
        			image: busybox
        			
        		#Download index.html and store into work-dir
        			command:
        			- wget
        			- "-O"
        			- "/work-dir/index.html"
        			- http://kubernetes.io
        			volumeMounts:
        			- name: workdir
        				mountPath: "/work-dir"
        		dnsPolicy: Default
        		volumes:
        		- name: workdir
        			emptyDir: {}
        	
        
    
    To initialize nginx with some content:
    
    *   We create a local volume (work-dir)
    *   This volume is mapped into the nginx container path (/usr/share/nginx/html) where nginx serves static HTML content from
    *   An init container (install) that downloads the index.html file from the official Kubernetes webpage and stores it into the volume
    
    Copy
    
         
        kubectl apply -f ./initContainers/init-container.yaml
        	
        
    
2.  Refresh the page in Firefox
    
    You should see the Kubernetes page that has been downloaded by the init container.
    

## Init Containers Examined

Now let’s have a look at what has happened in the background.

1.  Start `k9s` and select the nginx-demo-init Pod and hit enter

2.  Select the install Container and hit enter
    
    ![](https://niklaushirt.github.io/images/init2.png)
    
3.  You can see that the shell command has downloaded the html code into the work-dir volume.

4.  Hit `ESC` to go back and select the nginx Container and hit enter
    
    ![](https://niklaushirt.github.io/images/init5.png)
    
5.  Nginx is serving the index.html page from the work-dir volume.

6.  If you go back with `ESC` you can also have a look at how the two other containers have slept ;-)

7.  Quit k9s by hitting `Ctrl-C` several times
