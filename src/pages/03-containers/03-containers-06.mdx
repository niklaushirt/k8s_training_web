## ðŸš€ TASK: Run the frontend Image from the registry

1.  Now letâ€™s start the Web Frontend container with the image from the registry
    
    
    ```bash       
    podman run -d --rm --name k8sdemo -p 3000:3000 --env BACKEND_URL=http://k8sdemo-backend:3000/api --network shared  $(minikube ip):5000/k8sdemo:lab
    ```

    ```output   
    > b6e46d8bd60978af7e9e45260111e938da63a64247c9cff3b4e398a6498670a6

    ```

    This command runs the frontend server:

    *   `â€“rm` makes sure that the container is deleted once itâ€™s stopped
    *   `â€“name` gives the container a fixed name
    *   `â€“env` defines the environment variable that points to theÂ `k8sdemo-backend`Â server API
    *   `-p` exposes the container port 3000 to the outside port 3000
    *   `-d` runs the container in the background (as a daemon)
    *   `localhost:5000/k8sdemo:lab` is the image we have pushed to the registry before


2.  Go back to your browser and refresh theÂ `k8sdemo`Â web application to make sure that the container has been started.
