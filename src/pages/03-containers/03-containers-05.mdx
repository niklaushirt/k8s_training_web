## ðŸš€ TASK: Create a private registry    

1. To pursue this chapter you have to enable the registry in minikube by executing the following:

    ```bash      
    minikube addons enable registry
    ```     



## ðŸš€ TASK: Push the frontend Image to the registry


1.  Letâ€™s tag the image with the address of the local Docker registry (localhost:40451).
    
    
    ```bash      
    podman tag k8sdemo:lab $(minikube ip):5000/k8sdemo:lab
    ```     
        
    
2.  Expose the local Docker registry.
    
    First execute this in order to be able to access the private registry:
    
    
    ```bash      
    kubectl port-forward --namespace kube-system $(kubectl get po -n kube-system | grep -v registry-proxy |grep registry | \awk '{print $1;}') 40451:40451  > /dev/null&
    ```     
    
    This exposes the Docker Registry to the Terminal we are using.

    If you donâ€™t get a command line prompt, pressÂ `enter`Â several times If you get an error stating that the address is already in use you can ignore it
    </InlineNotification>
    
3.  And now push the image to the local registry:
    
    
    ```bash      
    podman push --tls-verify=false $(minikube ip):5000/k8sdemo:lab
    ```     
    

<InlineNotification kind="info">

Now the image is available to be aquired (pulled) from any machine that has access to the Docker registry.
