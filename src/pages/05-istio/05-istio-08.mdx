title: "Traffic Mirroring"
---



Traffic mirroring, also called shadowing, is a powerful concept that provides a risk-free method of testing your releases in the production environment without impacting your end users.

Instead of using traditional pre-production environments which used to be a replica of production, mirroring can provide synthetic traffic to mimic the live environment.

Traffic monitoring works in the following way:

*   You deploy a new version of your component (v2)
*   The existing version (v1) works loke before but sends an asynchronous copy to the new version
*   The new version (v2) processes the incoming traffic but does not respond to the user (fire-and-forget)
*   The Dev and Ops teams can monitor the new version in order to identify potential problems before starting the rollout

Let’s start the Lab.

1.  Create a Virtual Service that sends all traffic to v1 of the `reviews` service
    
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
    kind: VirtualService
    metadata:
        name: reviews
    spec:
        hosts:
        - reviews
        http:
        - route:
            - destination:
                    host: reviews
                    subset: v1     	
    ```
    
    Run the following:
    
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f ./training/istio/samples/bookinfo/networking/virtual-service-all-v1.yaml
    ```        		
        
    ```output
    > virtualservice.networking.istio.io/reviews configured
    ```
    
2.  Create a Virtual Service that sends all traffic to v1 and mirrors it to v2 of the `reviews` service
    
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
    kind: VirtualService
    metadata:
        name: reviews
    spec:
        hosts:
        - reviews
        http:
        - route:
            - destination:
                    host: reviews
                    subset: v1
            mirror:
                host: nginx
                subset: v2
        mirror_percent: 100
    ```
        
    
    Run the following:
    
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f ./training/istio/samples/bookinfo/networking/virtual-service-mirror-v1-v2.yaml
    ```        		
        
    ```output
    > virtualservice.networking.istio.io/reviews configured
    ```        
    
    After a short while you should see traffic starting to flow from `reviews` (v2) to `ratings`, because `reviews` (v2) is receiving the mirrored traffic.
