Microservices and containers changed application design and deployment patterns, but along with them brought challenges like service discovery, routing, failure handling, and visibility to microservices. “Service mesh” architecture was born to handle these features. Applications are getting decoupled internally as microservices, and the responsibility of maintaining coupling between these microservices is passed to the service mesh.

[Istio](https://istio.io/), a joint collaboration between IBM, Google and Lyft provides an easy way to create a service mesh that will manage many of these complex tasks automatically, without the need to modify the microservices themselves. Istio does this by:

1.  Deploying a **control plane** that manages the overall network infrastructure and enforces the policy and traffic rules defined by the devops team
    
2.  Deploying a **data plane** which includes “sidecars”, secondary containers that sit along side of each instance of a microservice and act as a proxy to intercept all incoming and outgoing network traffic. Sidecars are implemented using Envoy, an open source edge proxy
    

Once Istio is installed some of the key feature which it makes available include

*   Traffic management using **Istio Pilot**: In addition to providing content and policy based load balancing and routing, Pilot also maintains a canonical representation of services in the mesh.
    
*   Access control using **Istio Auth**: Istio Auth secures the service-to-service communication and also provides a key management system to manage keys and certificates.
    
*   Monitoring, reporting and quota management using **Istio Mixer**: Istio Mixer provides in depth monitoring and logs data collection for microservices, as well as collection of request traces. Precondition checking like whether the service consumer is on whitelist, quota management like rate limits etc. are also configured using Mixer.
    

In the first part of this journey we show how we can deploy the sample [BookInfo](https://istio.io/docs/samples/bookinfo.html) application and inject sidecars to get the Istio features mentioned above, and walk through the key ones. The BookInfo is a simple application that is composed of four microservices, written in different languages for each of its microservices namely Python, Java, Ruby, and Node.js. The application does not use a database, and stores everything in local filesystem.

Also since Istio tightly controls traffic routing to provide above mentioned benefits, it introduces some drawbacks. Outgoing traffic to external services outside the Istio data plane can only be enabled by specialized configuration, based on the protocol used to connect to the external service.

In the [second part](https://niklaushirt.github.io/k8s_training_web/jtc10/lab1/#part-b-modify-sample-application-to-use-an-external-datasource-deploy-the-application-and-istio-envoys-with-egress-traffic-enabled) of the journey we focus on how Istio can be configured to allow applications to connect to external services. For that we modify the sample BookInfo application to use an external database and then use it as a base to show Istio configuration for enabling egress traffic.
