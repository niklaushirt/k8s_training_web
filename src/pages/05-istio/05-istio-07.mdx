title: "End-user authentication"
---


Istio provides two types of authentication:

*   **Peer authentication**: used for service-to-service authentication to verify the client making the connection. Istio offers mutual TLS for transport authentication, which can be enabled without requiring service code changes.
    
    *   Provides each service with a strong identity representing its role to enable interoperability across clusters and clouds.
    *   Secures service-to-service communication.
    *   Provides a key management system to automate key and certificate generation, distribution, and rotation.
*   **Request authentication**: Used for end-user authentication to verify the credential attached to the request. Istio enables request-level authentication with JSON Web Token (JWT) validation and custom authentication via any OpenID Connect providers, for example:
    
    *   Keycloak
    *   Auth0
    *   Google Auth

Istio stores the authentication policies in Customresources.

Request authentication policies specify the values needed to validate a JSON Web Token (JWT). These values include, among others, the following:

*   The location of the token in the request
*   The issuer or the request
*   The public JSON Web Key Set (JWKS)

Istio checks the presented token, if presented against the rules in the request authentication policy, and rejects requests with invalid tokens. **When requests carry no token, they are accepted by default**. To reject requests without tokens, you have to provide authorization rules that specify the restrictions for specific operations.

You can find mor information here: [https://istio.io/latest/docs/tasks/security/authentication/authn-policy/](https://istio.io/latest/docs/tasks/security/authentication/authn-policy/)

For this lab we use the test tokens from [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/istio/istio/release-1.6/security/tools/jwt/samples/](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/istio/istio/release-1.6/security/tools/jwt/samples/jwks.json).

## Request Authentication

1.  Get the Cluster IP (MY-CLUSTER-IP)
    
    Use the adequate method for this:
    
    Minikube in the training VM
    
    ```bash
    minikube ip
    ```        
    
        	$(minikube ip)
        
    
2.  Try to access the productpage:
    
    ```bash
    export INGRESS_HOST=http://$(minikube ip):30762
    curl localhost:8080/productpage -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n"
    ```
        
    ```output
    > 200
    ```
    
    You should get an HTTP Code 200 - which means that the access is working. You can also try to refresh the productpage, it should load perfectly.
    
3.  Create the `RequestAuthentication` Object
    
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
    apiVersion: "security.istio.io/v1beta1"
    kind: "RequestAuthentication"
    metadata:
        name: "jwt-example"
        namespace: istio-system
    spec:
        selector:
            matchLabels:
                istio: ingressgateway
        jwtRules:
        - issuer: "testing@secure.istio.io"
          jwksUri: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/istio/istio/release-1.6/security/tools/jwt/samples/jwks.json"
    EOF
    ```        
    
        > requestauthentication.security.istio.io/jwt-example created
        
    
    Here we create the RequestAuthentication Object based on the test/demo tokens provided by Istio: [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/istio/istio/release-1.6/security/tools/jwt/samples/](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/istio/istio/release-1.6/security/tools/jwt/samples/jwks.json).
    
    The JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) is a set of keys which contains the public keys used to verify any JSON Web Token (JWT).
    
4.  Try to access the productpage again:
    
    ```bash
    curl $INGRESS_HOST/productpage -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n"
    ```        	
        
    ```output
    > 200
    ```
        
    
    You should still get an HTTP Code 200 - which means that the access is working, because requests that carry no token, are accepted by default.
    
5.  However trying to access the productpage with an invalid token should not work:
    
    ```bash
    curl --header "Authorization: Bearer my-invalid-token" $INGRESS_HOST/productpage -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n"
    ```
    
    ```output
    > 401
    ```        
    
    You should get an HTTP Code 401 (Unauthorized) - which means that the access is blocked if you use an invalid token.
    

## Autorisation Policy

1.  Create the `AutorisationPolicy` So to reject requests that carry no token, we have to provide authorization rules that specify the restrictions for specific operations, for example paths or actions. The following `AuthorizationPolicy` contains a rule specifying a DENY action for requests without request principals:
    
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
    apiVersion: "security.istio.io/v1beta1"
    kind: "AuthorizationPolicy"
    metadata:
        name: "frontend-ingress"
        namespace: istio-system
    spec:
        selector:
            matchLabels:
                istio: ingressgateway
        action: DENY
        rules:
        - from:
            - source:
                    notRequestPrincipals: ["*"]
    EOF
    ```          
        
    ```output
    > authorizationpolicy.security.istio.io/frontend-ingress created
    ```

2.  Try to access the productpage again:
    
    ```bash
    curl $INGRESS_HOST/productpage -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n"
    ```        	
        
    ```output
    > 403
    ```        
    
    You should get an HTTP Code 403 (Forbidden) - which means that the access is now blocked if you provide no token.
    

## Autorisation with JWT

Now, to validate that the access works with a valid JWT token, we call the URL with the JWT token provided by Istio: [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/istio/istio/release-1.6/security/tools/jwt/samples/](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/istio/istio/release-1.6/security/tools/jwt/samples/demo.jwt) that will be validated by the JWKS public key defined in the `RequestAuthentication`.

```bash
TOKEN=$(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/istio/istio/release-1.6/security/tools/jwt/samples/demo.jwt -s)
curl --header "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" $INGRESS_HOST/productpage -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n"
```    

```output
> 200
```
    

You should get an HTTP Code 200 - which means that the access is working, because the JWT token has been validated againts the JWKS.

## Autorisation with custom JWT

In the previous example we have been using a pre-created JWT token provided by Istio. In this Lab we are going to create a custom JWT token based on the same private key that has been used for the previous one and that is being validated by the JWKS.

1.  Install the needed componenets and libraries
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt install python3-pip
    pip3 install jwcrypto
    ```        
    
2.  Install the python-based tool to generate valid JWT tokens
    
    ```bash
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/istio/istio/release-1.6/security/tools/jwt/samples/gen-jwt.py
    chmod +x gen-jwt.py
    ```        
    
3.  Get the private key from the Istio Git repository that we will use to sign the token
    
    ```bash
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/istio/istio/release-1.6/security/tools/jwt/samples/key.pem
    ```        	
        
    
4.  Create a JWT token to access the application
    
    ```bash
    TOKEN=$(./gen-jwt.py ./key.pem --expire 500000)
    echo $TOKEN 
    
    curl --header "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" $INGRESS_HOST/productpage -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n"
    ```        	
        
    
    ```output
    > 200
    ```
        
    

You should get an HTTP Code 200 - which means that the access is working, because our JWT token has been validated againts the JWKS.

1.  Create a JWT token with 5 seconds expiry to access the application
    
    ```bash
    TOKEN=$(./gen-jwt.py ./key.pem --expire 5)
    for i in `seq 1 10`; do curl --header "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" $INGRESS_HOST/productpage -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n"; sleep 1; done
    ```        	
        
    
    ```output
    > 200
    > 200
    > 200
    > 200
    > 200
    > 200
    > 401
    > 401
    > 401
    > 401
        ...

    ```
        
    
    You should get an HTTP Code 200 for about 5 seconds until the token expires, after which you will get a 401 error.
