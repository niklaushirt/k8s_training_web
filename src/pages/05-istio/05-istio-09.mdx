title: "Fault Injection"
---

To test microservices for resiliency, Istio allows us to inject delays and errors between services.

Let’s start the Lab.

1.  Let’s create a VirtualService that creates 50% of 501 errors when the `details` service is called.
    
    ```yaml
        apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
        kind: VirtualService
        metadata:
            name: details
        spec:
            hosts:
            - details
            http:
            - fault:
                abort:
                httpStatus: 500
                percentage:
                    value: 50
            route:
            - destination:
                host: details
                subset: v1
        ...
    ```        	
        
    
    Run the following:
    
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f ./istio/samples/bookinfo/networking/fault-injection-details-v1.yaml
    ```        	
        
    ```output
    > virtualservice.networking.istio.io/details created
    > destinationrule.networking.istio.io/details created
    ```

    
2.  In Kiali click on the productpage (orange) box and after a short while you should see 500 errors appearing. In the right side dtail panel you will see additional information about the problem in your communication between microservices.
